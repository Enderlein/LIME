# LIME
Library Metadata Enhancement Tool

# Purpose
Given an artist's name and a local music library, this program will attempt to apply accurate artist, track number, song name, and album name to each of the songs in the library according to Spotify's music database

Currently, the only available version is v1.0
Whenever I get some free time, I'll work on improving the UI and the speed of the program (it works fairly slow right now)
